			Calvin (Calvin & Hobbes)

Calvin is a fictional character, and is the title character of the comic strip Calvin and Hobbes by Bill Watterson. Calvin demonstrates a level of wisdom, vocabulary and humor unusual for a six-year-old boy. However, he is a stereotyped six-year-old and is seen as a misfit among his classmates: he absolutely hates baths, fears and hates his babysitter, refuses to go to school, frequently disobeys his parents, and is lazy and selfish. Calvin frequently loses himself in various fantastical worlds of his own imagining. On the rare occasions on which he applies himself, Calvin's projects in school are very well received, to his confusion or indifference. He shows relatively minor interest or success in interacting with any "real" characters, choosing instead to spend the majority of his time with Hobbes, with whom he frequently embarks on adventures, debates philosophical issues, plots various pranks against girls, and fights.

Named after 16th century theologian John Calvin,[1] the character of Calvin is presented as being intelligent and verbose, with an imagination that usually manifests itself in the comic strip as an apparent physical existence. He despises school as an institution, directly criticizing teaching methods and enforced conformity. He often delivers sarcastic responses to dull fact-oriented questions on tests. Calvin consistently receives bad grades, simply because the subjects do not interest him enough for him to work at them. Occasionally, Calvin will receive excellent grades for a project he truly was interested in, such as dinosaurs. Calvin has a wide vocabulary and an advanced sense of irony. His grapples with philosophical quandaries are explored most elaborately during hazardous sled and wagon rides, often visual metaphors for the point of discourse which are usually cut short by a crash, banal distraction, mischievous urge, or sarcastic retort from one of his parents.

Calvin frequently imagines himself as other human characters with super powers, usually to avoid difficult situations (like school tests). His alter egos are: Stupendous Man, Tracer Bullet, and Spaceman Spiff. Stupendous Man is when Calvin puts on a mask and cape and pretends to have super powers, often picturing his mom, babysitter, or teacher as villains. Tracer Bullet is when Calvin is a private eye and takes "cases," usually from his mom or teacher. As Spaceman Spiff, Calvin frequently crashes his spacecraft and is left on alien planets. Later Watterson said he regretted creating the Spaceman Spiff character due to lack of flexibility and humor.[2]
